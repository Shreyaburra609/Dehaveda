SOUND_BASICS = [
    {"title": "What is sound?", "detail": "Sound is a mechanical pressure wave travelling through a medium such as air, water or solid material. It needs matter to travel, which is why sound cannot cross a vacuum."},
    {"title": "How sound is produced", "detail": "A vibrating object pushes and pulls the surrounding particles, creating alternating compressions and rarefactions that spread outward as a wave."},
    {"title": "Vibration", "detail": "The back-and-forth motion of a source, such as a vocal fold, string or drum membrane, that starts the wave."},
    {"title": "Frequency", "detail": "The number of vibration cycles per second, measured in hertz. Healthy young human hearing spans roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz and narrows with age."},
    {"title": "Amplitude", "detail": "The size of the pressure change, perceived as loudness and measured on the logarithmic decibel scale. Sustained exposure above about 85 dB can damage hearing."},
    {"title": "Pitch", "detail": "The perceptual counterpart of frequency: higher frequency is heard as higher pitch, although perception is not perfectly linear."},
    {"title": "Resonance", "detail": "When a system is driven near its natural frequency it vibrates with larger amplitude. This is how instrument bodies and the vocal tract amplify particular tones."},
    {"title": "How humans hear", "detail": "Waves funnel through the outer ear, vibrate the eardrum, are amplified by three middle-ear bones, and move fluid in the cochlea. Hair cells convert that motion into nerve signals for the auditory cortex."},

MANAS_TOPICS = [
    {"title": "What is the mind?", "detail": "In everyday and traditional usage the mind refers to the whole of our thinking, feeling and willing. Scientifically, mental activity is understood as processes arising from the brain and nervous system in interaction with the body and environment.", "premium": False},
    {"title": "Brain vs mind", "detail": "The brain is a physical organ that can be imaged and dissected. The mind is the set of functions and experiences associated with brain activity. Talking about them separately is useful, but the mind is not a separate object located somewhere in the skull.", "premium": False},
    {"title": "Thoughts", "detail": "Thoughts are transient patterns of neural activity that carry meaning. Most arise without deliberate effort; noticing them without immediately acting on them is a trainable skill.", "premium": False},
    {"title": "Attention", "detail": "Attention selects a small part of available information for deeper processing. It has limited capacity, which is why task switching costs time and accuracy.", "premium": False},
    {"title": "Memory", "detail": "Memory involves encoding, storage and retrieval across sensory, working and long-term systems. Spacing, retrieval practice and sleep all strengthen retention.", "premium": False},
    {"title": "Emotions", "detail": "Emotions are coordinated bodily, behavioural and experiential responses that bias attention and decision making. Naming an emotion accurately can help regulate it.", "premium": True},
    {"title": "Perception", "detail": "Perception is an active construction: the brain combines incoming signals with prior expectation. Illusions are useful evidence of this predictive process.", "premium": True},
    {"title": "Habits", "detail": "Habits are cue-driven behaviours that require little conscious control. Changing a habit is usually easier by redesigning the cue and environment than by relying on willpower.", "premium": True},
    {"title": "Stress", "detail": "Stress is the body's mobilisation response to demand. Short bursts can improve performance, while prolonged activation is linked to poorer sleep, mood and cardiovascular health.", "premium": True},
    {"title": "Relaxation", "detail": "Slow breathing, progressive muscle relaxation and restful activity shift the balance toward parasympathetic activity, which is measurable as lowered heart rate and breathing rate.", "premium": True},
    {"title": "Sleep", "detail": "Most adults need about seven to nine hours. Sleep supports memory consolidation, emotional regulation and metabolic health; consistent timing matters as much as duration.", "premium": False},
    {"title": "Focus", "detail": "Sustained focus improves with removing interruptions, working in defined blocks, and taking genuine breaks. Focus is a state you set up conditions for, not something forced.", "premium": True},

    {"title": "Physical activity", "detail": "Regular moderate activity is consistently associated with improved mood and reduced anxiety symptoms in the general population."},
    {"title": "Breathing", "detail": "Slow paced breathing at around six breaths per minute can reduce measured arousal for many people. It is a self-regulation tool, not a treatment."},
